### Biography
I am an undergraduate student at Macalester College, currently in my senior year. I am a double major in Physics and Mathematics with a Concentration in Astronomy, and a minor in Data Science.

Cosmology has always been an interest of mine, yet, I haven't had many research opportunnities to pursue the field. However, I have been able to participate in numerous research opportunnities which has helped me solidify my interests.

> Specifically, I aim to conduct research that specializes in the intersection of cosmology/astrophysics, machine learning, and collaboration across fields.

These interests were honed in the Spring semester of my junior year when I took a topology class. The final project combined gravitational lensing, topological data analysis, and clustering algorithms into one, and has been one of the most exciting research experiences I've had to date.

### Personal

I grew up in the rural town of McGaheysville, VA, and spent most of my time and energy on school and sports.

My parents taught me how to swim at a young age. Shortly after moving to McGaheysville, I joined the Massanutten Marlins Summer League Swim Team. As I got older and more serious about swimming, I joined the Virginia Gators of Harrisonburg, a club swim team that swam year round. When I got to high school, I joined the varsity team and [made some waves my senior year](https://www.dnronline.com/sports/2021-22-all-valley-boys-swimmer-of-the-year-east-rockinghams-william-st-john/article_321a6c79-0466-53f2-95d3-c7eb6555ab54.html). 

Outside of swimming in high school, I was in the ERHS marching band as a percussion captain, coached for the Massanutten Marlins, earned my 2nd degree blackbelt in American Freestyle Martial Arts, and became an Eagle Scout where my project involved creating a [GaGa ball pit addition to my elementary school playground](https://www.facebook.com/reel/2425760157670268). Now in college, I am a captain of the Macalester Swim and Dive team; captain of the club water polo team, the Spawn of Neptune; and Tresurer of the Macalester Pep Band.

One of my more recent interests has been a project to develop a sensor and software that a swimmer can wear that records acceleration and rotation, allowing the coaches and swimmers to quantitatively measure technique. This project arose from my own greedy desires to [be like the pros](https://www.teamusa.com/news/2024/june/05/how-data-analytics-have-helped-swimmer-kate-douglass-become-a-paris-favorite), but in my search, I learned the commercial technology was way too [expensive](https://www.eolab.com/products) for me or even my DIII team to purchase.

So I set out on a mission to make something more accessible to non-professional, collegiate, and casual atheletes alike. Check out the [SwimSense article on my Research page](research/SwimSense/index.qmd) to learn more or reach out to me!
