### Biography
I am an undergraduate student at Macalester College, currently in my third year. I am majoring in Physics with a Concentration in Astronomy and will also graduate with a Minor in Mathematics.

Currently, cosmology sounds the most appealing to me, research-wise. I also enjoy thinking about astrophysical phenomena, their driving mechanisms, and their implications, which makes me think theory would be a good specialization as well. I also really enjoy programming and making models, so perhaps something in `computational theoretical cosmology`? At least it sounds cool.

Unfortunately, I haven't taken many astro courses at Macalester (there are really only 2), but I will be taking astrophysics this Spring!

Regardless, the reason I want to go into astrophysics/cosmology is:

> I believe cosmology is the field that can answer the biggest questions.


Even though I don't yet have the theory background of a graduate student, I have been fortunate enough to have had multiple astro-specific research opportunities. If you are interested, explore the research page to learn more about them,

### Personal

Want to mention

- Massanutten Marlins swimming and coaching
- Gators Swimming

I started swimming with the Massanutten Marlines summer league team in (enter year). I was the captain of my high school swim team and [made some splashes in the local news](https://www.dnronline.com/sports/2021-22-all-valley-boys-swimmer-of-the-year-east-rockinghams-william-st-john/article_321a6c79-0466-53f2-95d3-c7eb6555ab54.html) my senior year.
