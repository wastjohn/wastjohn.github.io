# Geometry vs Toplogy

|Geometry|Topology|

So what is it?

> **Topology** is the study of *continuous* functions.

# Continuity

|Naive Continuity|Rigorous Continuity|

We want a definition of continuity that doesn't rely on distance. Enter open sets.

## Open Sets

> **Definition**: If $S\subset\mathbb{R}$ then $S$ is open if $\forall x \in S \exists$ some open interval $(x-\delta_x, x+\delta_x)$ (where $\delta_x>0$) contained within $S$.

Note that $(x-\delta_x, x+\delta_x)$ is sometimes called an open neighborhood or "breathing space".

## Closed Sets

> **Definition**: A subset $S\subset\mathbb{R}$ is closed if its compliment $\mathbb{R}-S$ is open.

## Continuity by Open Sets

> **Definition**: If $f:D\rightarrow C$ is a function, and $S$ is a subset of $C$, then the primage of $S$ under $f$, written $f^{-1}(S)$, is the subset of $D$ defined by $$f^{-1}(S) = {x\in D, f(x)\in S}$$

In other words, the preimage of $S$ consists of all the points which get mapped to $S$ by $f$.
