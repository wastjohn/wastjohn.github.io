        "a) Taking into consideration the Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution, what temperature would be required for two protons to collide if quantum mechanical tunneling is neglected?  You may assume that nuclei having velocities 8x the RMS values for the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution can overcome the Coulomb barrier.  Compare your answer with the estimated central temperature of the Sun.\n",
        "b) Using the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, determine the ratio of the number of protons having velocities 8x the RMS value to those moving at the RMS velocity.\n",
        "c) Assuming (incorrectly) that the Sun is pure hydrogen, estimate the number of hydrogen nuclei in the Sun.  Could there be enough protons moving with speed 8x the RMS value to account for the Sun’s luminosity?  How long could these reactions sustain the current Solar luminosity?  Hint: you may assume that the number of protons with velocity $\\sim v_{rms}$ is most of the hydrogen atoms.\n"
