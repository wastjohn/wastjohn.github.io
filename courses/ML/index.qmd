> Machine Learning: using algorithms that can learn from existing patterns and make predictions

## Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning

**Supervised Learning**

- model relationship between input $x = (x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_p)$ and output $y$.

$$\begin{align*}y &= f(x) + \epsilon \\ &= \text{ trend in relationship } + \text{ residual deviation from trend }\end{align*}$$

- Types:
  - Regression ($y$ is quantitative)
  - Classification ($y$ is categorical)

**Unsupervised Learning**

- No output variable
- Goal is to use $x$ to understand/modify strucutre of data with respect to $x$
- Types:
  - Clustering (similar $x$'s')
  - Dimension Reduction (turn original set of $p$ input varaibles into set with $k<p$ variables)
