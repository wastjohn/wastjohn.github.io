    "text": "At Massanutten Regional Governor’s School (MRGS), students take a research course where they are given the opportunnity to work with outside mentors. I was fortunate enough to be able to work with Dr. Anca Constantin, a professor in JMU’s Physics and Astronomy Department, during my two years at MRGS.\nThe goal of our project was to learn more about water megamasers by examining the optical spectra of a large dataset of confirmed megamasers. This was done by crossmatching a catalog of known megamasers, provided by the Megamaser Cosmology Project (MCP), with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Python was used for data manipulation and visualization. SQL was used for data filtering in the SDSS. If interested, you can download a copy of my end-of-year/ISEF presentation.\n\nAt the end of my senior year, this project was entered into the Shenandoah Valley Regional Science Fair, where it won first place in its division, allowing it to be entered into the Virginia State Science and Engineering Fair. It was also a finalist project in the 2022 International Science and Engineering Fair. Here is the link to the ISEF abstract.\nThis was my first hands-on experience working with Python, SQL, and astronomy research in general. I am incredibly thankful for Dr. Constantin for the opportunnity to work with her, and for Mr. Russel Kohrs and Ms. Jennifer Moyers of MRGS for advising me on this two-year project."

    "text": "Problem 1\nFor Winer Observatory,\n\nFind the altutude of the Sun along the meridian on the first day of summer and\n\n\nAnswer: The first day of summer is the corresponds to the summer solstice, at which the Sun is at a declination of around 23.5 degrees. Winer observatory is located at a latitude of 31.67 degrees. The following diagram can be made for an observer at Winer.\n\nFrom this geometry, we can construct the following relationship between the zenith \\(z\\), declination \\(\\delta\\), and altitude \\(A\\)\n\\[A = 90 - z + \\delta\\]\nUsing this equation, we can plug in the zenith/latitude of Winer and the declination of the Sun at the summer solstice to find the altitude of the Sun at Winer on the summer solstice.\n\\[ A = 90 - 31.67 + 23.5 = \\boxed{81.83 \\text{ deg}} \\]\n\n\nthe maximum altidue of the sun on the first day of winter.\n\n\nAnswer: Using the equation above, we can plug in the declination of the Sun on the winter solstice (-23.5 degrees) to solve for the altitude from Winer.\n\\[ A = 90 - 31.67 - 23.5 = \\boxed{34.83 \\text{ deg}} \\]\n\n\nHow do you expect these altitudes to change for an observer at Macalester?\n\n\nAnswer: Macalester is at a higher latitude, so we would expect the respective altitudes to be lower. Using the nifty equation we found early, we can find how much lower exactly.\nFor some target at Winer, the altitude is\n\\[A_w = 90 - z_w + \\delta \\]\nFor the same target at Mac, the altitude is\n\\[A_m = 90 - z_m + \\delta\\]\nThus, the difference between altitudes at Mac and Winer is\n\\[A_m - A_w = z_w - z_m = 31.67 - 45 = -13.33\\]\nand\n\\[\\boxed{A_m = A_w - 13.33}\\]\nSo the altitudes at Mac are 13.33 degrees lower than the altitudes at Winer.\n\n\n\nProblem 2\nCongratulations! You’ve been awarded 4 hours of observing time on the Subaru Telescope on Manua Kea on March 18 (yay, spring break trip to Hawaii!).\n\nWhat is the Subaru telescope? What portions of the electromagnetic spectrum will you observe in?\n\n\nAnswer: The Subaru telescope is an 8.2 meter optical and near infrared telescope located near the summit of Maunakea, Hawaii, operated by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ), National Institutes of Natural Sciences. We could abserve in visible and near infrared portions of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\n\nOf the following objects, which will you be able to observe if your time starts at 10:00 PM? NGC 13, NGC 2213, NGC 3019, NGC 4214, NGC 5808, NGC 6680, NGC 7111. You may find the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (aka NED, https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/) helpful.\n\n\nAnswer: Below is a table of target names and coordinates.\n\nTarget list\n\n\nname\n\\(\\alpha\\) [deg]\n\\(\\delta\\) [deg]\n\n\n\n\nNGC 13\n2.1987\n33.4333\n\n\nNGC 2213\n92.6753\n-71.5286\n\n\nNGC 3019\n147.5299\n12.7461\n\n\nNGC 4214\n183.9132\n36.3269\n\n\nNGC 5808\n223.5115\n73.1317\n\n\nNGC 6680\n279.9332\n22.3165\n\n\nNGC 7111\n325.4739\n-6.7088\n\n\n\nMarch 18th is nearly the vernal equinox, which means the Sun will have a right ascension around 0 deg. Thus, we can consider the bad range of \\(\\alpha\\) values to be 270-90 deg and the good range of \\(\\alpha\\) values to be 90-270 deg. This allows us to get rid of NGC 13, NGC 6680, and NGC 7111 due to their \\(\\alpha\\) values near the Sun.\nWe can also get rid of NGC 2213, as it has a declination of -71 degrees, which is unobservable from the Subaru telescope given its latitude of 19.8255 degrees North (19.8255 - 90 = -70 = minimum declination for possible observation).\n\nRevised target list\n\n\nname\n\\(\\alpha\\) [deg]\n\\(\\delta\\) [deg]\n\n\n\n\nNGC 3019\n147.5299\n12.7461\n\n\nNGC 4214\n183.9132\n36.3269\n\n\nNGC 5808\n223.5115\n73.1317\n\n\n\nSince we are near the vernal equinox, at noon we expect the Sun to be directly overhead, making the LST around 0 hours. At midnight, we expect the LST to be around 12. Thus two hours earlier, when our observation block starts, we expect to have an LST of around 10. We know the following relation.\n\\[HA = LST - \\alpha\\]\nIf we convert our \\(\\alpha\\)’s to hours from degrees, we can solve for the hour angles of each target to determine if we can see them in our observing block.\n\\[HA = 10 - \\begin{pmatrix}9.8 \\\\ 12.2 \\\\ 14.9\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}0.2 \\\\ -2.2 \\\\ -4.9\\end{pmatrix}\\]\nIn other words, at 10 pm local time at the Subaru Telescope, NGC 3019 will be almost directly overhead; two hours later, NGC 4214 will be transiting; and at the end of our session, NGC 5808 will be rising/an hour away from transiting.\n\n\n\nProblem 3\nUse Simbad (https://simbad.cds.unistra.fr/simbad/) to look up the parallax and J2000 coordinates to the three brightest stars in the constellation Orion’s belt: Alnilam, Alnitak, and Mintaka.\n\nWhat can you learn about the motion of these stars on Simbad\n\n\nAnswer: Alnilam is moving at 1.44 and -0.78 milliarcseconds/year in right ascension and declination, respectively, and away from us at 27.30 km/s. Alnitak is moving at 3.19 and 2.03 milliarcseconds/year in right ascension and declination, respectively, and away from us at 18.50 km/s. Mintaka is moving at 0.65 and -0.69 milliarcseconds/year in right ascension and declination, respectively, and away from us at 18.50 km/s.\n\n\nWhat are the distances to the stars in parsecs?\n\n\nAnswer: According to Simbad, the parallax of these stars is the following\n\n\n\nname\nparallax [mas]\n\n\n\n\nAlnilam\n1.65\n\n\nAlnitak\n4.43\n\n\nMintaka\n4.71\n\n\n\nUsing the relation between parallax \\(p\\) and distance \\(d\\),\n\\[d_{pc} = \\frac{1}{p_{arcsec}}\\]\nwe can find the disances for each star to be the following.\n\n\n\nname\nparallax [mas]\ndistances [pc]\n\n\n\n\nAlnilam\n1.65\n606\n\n\nAlnitak\n4.43\n226\n\n\nMintaka\n4.71\n212\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the two stars with the most similar distances, calculate their angular separation and minimum physical separation (assuming they are both at a distance equal to that of the nearest of the two stars).\n\n\nAnswer: Angular separation between two points on the celestial sphere is defined by \\[(\\Delta \\theta)^2 = (\\Delta\\alpha\\cos\\delta)^2 + (\\Delta\\delta)^2\\]\nThe physical separation can be found by the small angle formula, namely\n\\[\\theta_{rad} = \\frac{D}{d}\\]\nThe following code chuck solves for the angular and physical separation given the coordinates of the two stars and the distance to the closest star.\n\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport astropy.units as u\nalnitak = (085.18969443 * u.deg,-01.94257359 * u.deg)\nmintaka = (083.00166706 * u.deg,-00.29909511 * u.deg)\nmintaka_parallax = 4.71 * u.arcsec * 10**-3\nara, adec = alnitak\nmra, mdec = mintaka\ndra = ara - mra\nddec = adec - mdec\n\ntheta = np.sqrt((dra * np.cos(adec))**2 + ddec**2).to(u.rad)\ndistance = mintaka_parallax.to(u.parsec, equivalencies=u.parallax())\nseparation = theta * distance\n\nprint(f\"\"\"Alnitak and Mintaka are separated by {theta.to(u.deg):.2f}, \nwhich corresponds to a physical separation of {separation / u.rad:.2f}\"\"\")\n\nAlnitak and Mintaka are separated by 2.74 deg, \nwhich corresponds to a physical separation of 10.14 pc"
