I was fortunate enough to be able to work with Dr. Anca Constantin, a professor in JMU’s Physics and Astronomy Department, during my two years at MRGS.\nThe goal of our project was to learn more about water megamasers by examining the optical spectra of a large dataset of confirmed megamasers. This was done by crossmatching a catalog of known megamasers, provided by the Megamaser Cosmology Project (MCP), with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Python was used for data manipulation and visualization. SQL was used for data filtering in the SDSS. If interested, you can download a copy of my end-of-year/ISEF presentation.\n\nAt the end of my senior year, this project was entered into the Shenandoah Valley Regional Science Fair, where it won first place in its division, allowing it to be entered into the Virginia State Science and Engineering Fair. It was also a finalist project in the 2022 International Science and Engineering Fair. Here is the link to the ISEF abstract.\nThis was my first hands-on experience working with Python, SQL, and astronomy research in general. I am incredibly thankful for Dr. Constantin for the opportunnity to work with her, and for Mr. Russel Kohrs and Ms. Jennifer Moyers of MRGS for advising me on this two-year project."

    "text": "Problem 1\nFor Winer Observatory,\n\nFind the altutude of the Sun along the meridian on the first day of summer and\n\n\nAnswer: The first day of summer is the corresponds to the summer solstice, at which the Sun is at a declination of around 23.5 degrees. Winer observatory is located at a latitude of 31.67 degrees. The following diagram can be made for an observer at Winer.\n\nFrom this geometry, we can construct the following relationship between the zenith \\(z\\), declination \\(\\delta\\), and altitude \\(A\\)\n\\[A = 90 - z + \\delta\\]\nUsing this equation, we can plug in the zenith/latitude of Winer and the declination of the Sun at the summer solstice to find the altitude of the Sun at Winer on the summer solstice.\n\\[ A = 90 - 31.67 + 23.5 = \\boxed{81.83 \\text{ deg}} \\]\n\n\nthe maximum altidue of the sun on the first day of winter.\n\n\nAnswer: Using the equation above, we can plug in the declination of the Sun on the winter solstice (-23.5 degrees) to solve for the altitude from Winer.\n\\[ A = 90 - 31.67 - 23.5 = \\boxed{34.83 \\text{ deg}} \\]\n\n\nHow do you expect these altitudes to change for an observer at Macalester?\n\n\nAnswer: Macalester is at a higher latitude, so we would expect the respective altitudes to be lower. Using the nifty equation we found early, we can find how much lower exactly.\nFor some target at Winer, the altitude is\n\\[A_w = 90 - z_w + \\delta \\]\nFor the same target at Mac, the altitude is\n\\[A_m = 90 - z_m + \\delta\\]\nThus, the difference between altitudes at Mac and Winer is\n\\[A_m - A_w = z_w - z_m = 31.67 - 45 = -13.33\\]\nand\n\\[\\boxed{A_m = A_w - 13.33}\\]\nSo the altitudes at Mac are 13.33 degrees lower than the altitudes at Winer.\n\n\n\nProblem 2\nCongratulations! You’ve been awarded 4 hours of observing time on the Subaru Telescope on Manua Kea on March 18 (yay, spring break trip to Hawaii!).\n\nWhat is the Subaru telescope? What portions of the electromagnetic spectrum will you observe in?\n\n\nAnswer: The Subaru telescope is an 8.2 meter optical and near infrared telescope located near the summit of Maunakea, Hawaii, operated by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ), National Institutes of Natural Sciences. We could abserve in visible and near infrared portions of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\n\nOf the following objects, which will you be able to observe if your time starts at 10:00 PM? NGC 13, NGC 2213, NGC 3019, NGC 4214, NGC 5808, NGC 6680, NGC 7111. You may find the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (aka NED, https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/) helpful.\n\n\nAnswer: Below is a table of target names and coordinates.\n\nTarget list\n\n\nname\n\\(\\alpha\\) [deg]\n\\(\\delta\\) [deg]\n\n\n\n\nNGC 13\n2.1987\n33.4333\n\n\nNGC 2213\n92.6753\n-71.5286\n\n\nNGC 3019\n147.5299\n12.7461\n\n\nNGC 4214\n183.9132\n36.3269\n\n\nNGC 5808\n223.5115\n73.1317\n\n\nNGC 6680\n279.9332\n22.3165\n\n\nNGC 7111\n325.4739\n-6.7088\n\n\n\nMarch 18th is nearly the vernal equinox, which means the Sun will have a right ascension around 0 deg. Thus, we can consider the bad range of \\(\\alpha\\) values to be 270-90 deg and the good range of \\(\\alpha\\) values to be 90-270 deg. This allows us to get rid of NGC 13, NGC 6680, and NGC 7111 due to their \\(\\alpha\\) values near the Sun.\nWe can also get rid of NGC 2213, as it has a declination of -71 degrees, which is unobservable from the Subaru telescope given its latitude of 19.8255 degrees North (19.8255 - 90 = -70 = minimum declination for possible observation).\n\nRevised target list\n\n\nname\n\\(\\alpha\\) [deg]\n\\(\\delta\\) [deg]\n\n\n\n\nNGC 3019\n147.5299\n12.7461\n\n\nNGC 4214\n183.9132\n36.3269\n\n\nNGC 5808\n223.5115\n73.1317\n\n\n\nSince we are near the vernal equinox, at noon we expect the Sun to be directly overhead, making the LST around 0 hours. At midnight, we expect the LST to be around 12. Thus two hours earlier, when our observation block starts, we expect to have an LST of around 10. We know the following relation.\n\\[HA = LST - \\alpha\\]\nIf we convert our \\(\\alpha\\)’s to hours from degrees, we can solve for the hour angles of each target to determine if we can see them in our observing block.\n\\[HA = 10 - \\begin{pmatrix}9.8 \\\\ 12.2 \\\\ 14.9\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}0.2 \\\\ -2.2 \\\\ -4.9\\end{pmatrix}\\]\nIn other words, at 10 pm local time at the Subaru Telescope, NGC 3019 will be almost directly overhead; two hours later, NGC 4214 will be transiting; and at the end of our session, NGC 5808 will be rising/an hour away from transiting.\n\n\n\nProblem 3\nUse Simbad (https://simbad.cds.unistra.fr/simbad/) to look up the parallax and J2000 coordinates to the three brightest stars in the constellation Orion’s belt: Alnilam, Alnitak, and Mintaka.\n\nWhat can you learn about the motion of these stars on Simbad\n\n\nAnswer: Alnilam is moving at 1.44 and -0.78 milliarcseconds/year in right ascension and declination, respectively, and away from us at 27.30 km/s. Alnitak is moving at 3.19 and 2.03 milliarcseconds/year in right ascension and declination, respectively, and away from us at 18.50 km/s. Mintaka is moving at 0.65 and -0.69 milliarcseconds/year in right ascension and declination, respectively, and away from us at 18.50 km/s.\n\n\nWhat are the distances to the stars in parsecs?\n\n\nAnswer: According to Simbad, the parallax of these stars is the following\n\n\n\nname\nparallax [mas]\n\n\n\n\nAlnilam\n1.65\n\n\nAlnitak\n4.43\n\n\nMintaka\n4.71\n\n\n\nUsing the relation between parallax \\(p\\) and distance \\(d\\),\n\\[d_{pc} = \\frac{1}{p_{arcsec}}\\]\nwe can find the disances for each star to be the following.\n\n\n\nname\nparallax [mas]\ndistances [pc]\n\n\n\n\nAlnilam\n1.65\n606\n\n\nAlnitak\n4.43\n226\n\n\nMintaka\n4.71\n212\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the two stars with the most similar distances, calculate their angular separation and minimum physical separation (assuming they are both at a distance equal to that of the nearest of the two stars).\n\n\nAnswer: Angular separation between two points on the celestial sphere is defined by \\[(\\Delta \\theta)^2 = (\\Delta\\alpha\\cos\\delta)^2 + (\\Delta\\delta)^2\\]\nThe physical separation can be found by the small angle formula, namely\n\\[\\theta_{rad} = \\frac{D}{d}\\]\nThe following code chuck solves for the angular and physical separation given the coordinates of the two stars and the distance to the closest star.\n\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport astropy.units as u\nalnitak = (085.18969443 * u.deg,-01.94257359 * u.deg)\nmintaka = (083.00166706 * u.deg,-00.29909511 * u.deg)\nmintaka_parallax = 4.71 * u.arcsec * 10**-3\nara, adec = alnitak\nmra, mdec = mintaka\ndra = ara - mra\nddec = adec - mdec\n\ntheta = np.sqrt((dra * np.cos(adec))**2 + ddec**2).to(u.rad)\ndistance = mintaka_parallax.to(u.parsec, equivalencies=u.parallax())\nseparation = theta * distance\n\nprint(f\"\"\"Alnitak and Mintaka are separated by {theta.to(u.deg):.2f}, \nwhich corresponds to a physical separation of {separation / u.rad:.2f}\"\"\")\n\nAlnitak and Mintaka are separated by 2.74 deg, \nwhich corresponds to a physical separation of 10.14 pc"

The following diagram can be made for an observer at Winer.\n\nFrom this geometry, we can construct the following relationship between the zenith \\(z\\), declination \\(\\delta\\), and altitude \\(A\\)\n\\[A = 90 - z + \\delta\\]\nUsing this equation, we can plug in the zenith/latitude of Winer and the declination of the Sun at the summer solstice to find the altitude of the Sun at Winer on the summer solstice.\n\\[ A = 90 - 31.67 + 23.5 = \\boxed{81.83 \\text{ deg}} \\]\n\n\nthe maximum altidue of the sun on the first day of winter.\n\n\nAnswer: Using the equation above, we can plug in the declination of the Sun on the winter solstice (-23.5 degrees) to solve for the altitude from Winer.\n\\[ A = 90 - 31.67 - 23.5 = \\boxed{34.83 \\text{ deg}} \\]\n\n\nHow do you expect these altitudes to change for an observer at Macalester?\n\n\nAnswer: Macalester is at a higher latitude, so we would expect the respective altitudes to be lower. Using the nifty equation we found early, we can find how much lower exactly.\nFor some target at Winer, the altitude is\n\\[A_w = 90 - z_w + \\delta \\]\nFor the same target at Mac, the altitude is\n\\[A_m = 90 - z_m + \\delta\\]\nThus, the difference between altitudes at Mac and Winer is\n\\[A_m - A_w = z_w - z_m = 31.67 - 45 = -13.33\\]\nand\n\\[\\boxed{A_m = A_w - 13.33}\\]\nSo the altitudes at Mac are 13.33 degrees lower than the altitudes at Winer.\n\n\n\nProblem 2\nCongratulations! You’ve been awarded 4 hours of observing time on the Subaru Telescope on Manua Kea on March 18 (yay, spring break trip to Hawaii!).\n\nWhat is the Subaru telescope? What portions of the electromagnetic spectrum will you observe in?\n\n\nAnswer: The Subaru telescope is an 8.2 meter optical and near infrared telescope located near the summit of Maunakea, Hawaii, operated by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ), National Institutes of Natural Sciences. We could abserve in visible and near infrared portions of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\n\nOf the following objects, which will you be able to observe if your time starts at 10:00 PM? NGC 13, NGC 2213, NGC 3019, NGC 4214, NGC 5808, NGC 6680, NGC 7111. You may find the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (aka NED, https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/) helpful.\n\n\nAnswer: Below is a table of target names and coordinates.\n\nTarget list\n\n\nname\n\\(\\alpha\\) [deg]\n\\(\\delta\\) [deg]\n\n\n\n\nNGC 13\n2.1987\n33.4333\n\n\nNGC 2213\n92.6753\n-71.5286\n\n\nNGC 3019\n147.5299\n12.7461\n\n\nNGC 4214\n183.9132\n36.3269\n\n\nNGC 5808\n223.5115\n73.1317\n\n\nNGC 6680\n279.9332\n22.3165\n\n\nNGC 7111\n325.4739\n-6.7088\n\n\n\nMarch 18th is nearly the vernal equinox, which means the Sun will have a right ascension around 0 deg. Thus, we can consider the bad range of \\(\\alpha\\) values to be 270-90 deg and the good range of \\(\\alpha\\) values to be 90-270 deg. This allows us to get rid of NGC 13, NGC 6680, and NGC 7111 due to their \\(\\alpha\\) values near the Sun.\nWe can also get rid of NGC 2213, as it has a declination of -71 degrees, which is unobservable from the Subaru telescope given its latitude of 19.8255 degrees North (19.8255 - 90 = -70 = minimum declination for possible observation).\n\nRevised target list\n\n\nname\n\\(\\alpha\\) [deg]\n\\(\\delta\\) [deg]\n\n\n\n\nNGC 3019\n147.5299\n12.7461\n\n\nNGC 4214\n183.9132\n36.3269\n\n\nNGC 5808\n223.5115\n73.1317\n\n\n\nSince we are near the vernal equinox, at noon we expect the Sun to be directly overhead, making the LST around 0 hours. At midnight, we expect the LST to be around 12. Thus two hours earlier, when our observation block starts, we expect to have an LST of around 10. We know the following relation.\n\\[HA = LST - \\alpha\\]\nIf we convert our \\(\\alpha\\)’s to hours from degrees, we can solve for the hour angles of each target to determine if we can see them in our observing block.\n\\[HA = 10 - \\begin{pmatrix}9.8 \\\\ 12.2 \\\\ 14.9\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}0.2 \\\\ -2.2 \\\\ -4.9\\end{pmatrix}\\]\nIn other words, at 10 pm local time at the Subaru Telescope, NGC 3019 will be almost directly overhead; two hours later, NGC 4214 will be transiting; and at the end of our session, NGC 5808 will be rising/an hour away from transiting.\n\n\n\nProblem 3\nUse Simbad (https://simbad.cds.unistra.fr/simbad/) to look up the parallax and J2000 coordinates to the three brightest stars in the constellation Orion’s belt: Alnilam, Alnitak, and Mintaka.\n\nWhat can you learn about the motion of these stars on Simbad\n\n\nAnswer: Alnilam is moving at 1.44 and -0.78 milliarcseconds/year in right ascension and declination, respectively, and away from us at 27.30 km/s. Alnitak is moving at 3.19 and 2.03 milliarcseconds/year in right ascension and declination, respectively, and away from us at 18.50 km/s. Mintaka is moving at 0.65 and -0.69 milliarcseconds/year in right ascension and declination, respectively, and away from us at 18.50 km/s.\n\n\nWhat are the distances to the stars in parsecs?\n\n\nAnswer: According to Simbad, the parallax of these stars is the following\n\n\n\nname\nparallax [mas]\n\n\n\n\nAlnilam\n1.65\n\n\nAlnitak\n4.43\n\n\nMintaka\n4.71\n\n\n\nUsing the relation between parallax \\(p\\) and distance \\(d\\),\n\\[d_{pc} = \\frac{1}{p_{arcsec}}\\]\nwe can find the disances for each star to be the following.\n\n\n\nname\nparallax [mas]\ndistances [pc]\n\n\n\n\nAlnilam\n1.65\n606\n\n\nAlnitak\n4.43\n226\n\n\nMintaka\n4.71\n212\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the two stars with the most similar distances, calculate their angular separation and minimum physical separation (assuming they are both at a distance equal to that of the nearest of the two stars).\n\n\nAnswer: Angular separation between two points on the celestial sphere is defined by \\[(\\Delta \\theta)^2 = (\\Delta\\alpha\\cos\\delta)^2 + (\\Delta\\delta)^2\\]\nThe physical separation can be found by the small angle formula, namely\n\\[\\theta_{rad} = \\frac{D}{d}\\]\nThe following code chuck solves for the angular and physical separation given the coordinates of the two stars and the distance to the closest star.\n\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport astropy.units as u\nalnitak = (085.18969443 * u.deg,-01.94257359 * u.deg)\nmintaka = (083.00166706 * u.deg,-00.29909511 * u.deg)\nmintaka_parallax = 4.71 * u.arcsec * 10**-3\nara, adec = alnitak\nmra, mdec = mintaka\ndra = ara - mra\nddec = adec - mdec\n\ntheta = np.sqrt((dra * np.cos(adec))**2 + ddec**2).to(u.rad)\ndistance = mintaka_parallax.to(u.parsec, equivalencies=u.parallax())\nseparation = theta * distance\n\nprint(f\"\"\"Alnitak and Mintaka are separated by {theta.to(u.deg):.2f}, \nwhich corresponds to a physical separation of {separation / u.rad:.2f}\"\"\")\n\nAlnitak and Mintaka are separated by 2.74 deg, \nwhich corresponds to a physical separation of 10.14 pc"

Refer to https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01424 for relevant orbital parameters. Rank the orbital angular momentum of each planet from highest to lowest. Before you do any calculations take a stab at the ranking using your intuition and the derived equation. Compare your guess to the final ranking. Any surprises?\n\nAnswer: For our intuition approach, looking at the angular momention equation\n\\[L = \\mu\\sqrt{GMa(1-e^2)}\\]\nallows us to make some simplifications given our system’s properties. For starters, the system mass \\(M\\) is approximately the same for all orbits due to the mass of the star in comparison to the exoplanets. Additionally, the constant \\(G\\) will not change for each system. If we consider the reduced mass \\(mu\\), we can make the following simplification for a system with a very large (\\(m_1\\)) and very small mass (\\(m_2\\)).\n\\[\\mu = \\frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \\approx \\frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1} = m_2\\]\nThus, the primary characteristics for determining the angular momentum, by intuition, is the mass of the exoplanet, the semi-major axis, and the eccentricity.\n$$\\(L \\sim m_2 \\sqrt{a(1-e^2)}\\)\nUsing the values given in the paper, we predict the following.\n\ng (largest L)\nc\nb\nf\ne\nd (smallest L)\n\nChecking our values with a calculation…\n\n\nimport astropy.units as u\nimport astropy.constants as c\n\nstar_m = 0.0802 * c.M_sun\n\ndef L(m, a, e):\n    return ((star_m * m)/(star_m + m)) * (c.G * (star_m + m) * a * (1 - e**2)) ** 0.5\n\n# m, a, e\ntrappist_b = [0.85 * c.M_earth, 11.11 * u.au * 10 ** -3, 0.081]\ntrappist_c = [1.38 * c.M_earth, 15.21 * u.au * 10 ** -3, 0.083]\ntrappist_d = [0.41 * c.M_earth, 21.44 * u.au * 10 ** -3, 0.070]\ntrappist_e = [0.62 * c.M_earth, 28.17 * u.au * 10 ** -3, 0.085]\ntrappist_f = [0.68 * c.M_earth, 37.1 * u.au * 10 ** -3, 0.063]\ntrappist_g = [1.34 * c.M_earth, 45.1 * u.au * 10 ** -3, 0.061]\n\nlb = L(trappist_b[0], trappist_b[1], trappist_b[2]).to(u.kg * u.m ** 2 / u.s)\nlc = L(trappist_c[0], trappist_c[1], trappist_c[2]).to(u.kg * u.m ** 2 / u.s)\nld = L(trappist_d[0], trappist_d[1], trappist_d[2]).to(u.kg * u.m ** 2 / u.s)\nle = L(trappist_e[0], trappist_e[1], trappist_e[2]).to(u.kg * u.m ** 2 / u.s)\nlf = L(trappist_f[0], trappist_f[1], trappist_f[2]).to(u.kg * u.m ** 2 / u.s)\nlg = L(trappist_g[0], trappist_g[1], trappist_g[2]).to(u.kg * u.m ** 2 / u.s)\n\nprint(f\"L trappist b: {lb:.2e}\")\nprint(f\"L trappist c: {lc:.2e}\")\nprint(f\"L trappist d: {ld:.2e}\")\nprint(f\"L trappist e: {le:.2e}\")\nprint(f\"L trappist f: {lf:.2e}\")\nprint(f\"L trappist g: {lg:.2e}\")\n\nL trappist b: 6.73e+38 m2 kg / s\nL trappist c: 1.28e+39 m2 kg / s\nL trappist d: 4.51e+38 m2 kg / s\nL trappist e: 7.81e+38 m2 kg / s\nL trappist f: 9.85e+38 m2 kg / s\nL trappist g: 2.14e+39 m2 kg / s\n\n\n\nwe get agreement with the largest and smallest values,\n\ng (largest L)\nc\nf\ne\nb\nd (smallest L)\n\nwhich is relatively expected for a simple intution guess with no calculations.\n\n\n\nProblem 2\nComet C/2013 A1 (Siding Spring) was discovered in January 2013.

What is the interval between reception of two signals on Earth?\nIf the wavelength of the electromagnetic waves sent from Earth is 17 cm, what wavelength must the receivers on the spaceship must be tuned to receive the waves?\n\n\nAnswer: Problems a) and b) are essentially asking the same question: if an object is moving at relativistic speeds to a stationary observer, how will the interval in reception be affected in the stationary frame of reference. In both cases, we can use the time dilation formula.\nFrom a stationary frame of reference, moving clocks run slow. Thus, in both a) and b), we would expect the interval between receivers to be longer than 4 months. This is a similar argument to the Muon example in the textbook: in the muon’s stationary perspective, it has a short life, but to an external, stationary observer, the muon is moving at relativistic speeds and so the time it is alive is dilated, making the observer measure a longer time than the muon. In our case, the spaceship/earth are moving away from their respective stationary reference frames at relativistic speeds, but each party has agreed to transmit at a specific rate of 1 message every four months. Unfortunately, each receiver experiences the delay in messages as taking longer than 4 months due to the relativistic speeds each transmitter is moving at.\nAdditionally, the spaceship must tune their frequencies to a different wavelenth due to the relativistic motion of the transmitters. The relationship between observed and rest frequency is the following \\[\\nu_{obs} = \\nu_{rest} \\sqrt{\\frac{1-v/c}{1+v/c}}\\]\nNote that the conversion between wavelenth and frequency can be found using the simple relationship \\[c = \\lambda \\nu.\\]\nBelow is code that calculates the results described above.\n\n\n# time dilation\nv = 0.85 * c.c\nt_p = 4\ngamma = 1/np.sqrt(1 - (v/c.c) ** 2)\nt = 4 * gamma\n\n# redshift\nl_rest = 17 * u.cm\nf_rest = c.c / l_rest\nf_obs = f_rest * np.sqrt((1 - v/c.c) / (1 + v/c.c))\nl_obs = c.c / f_obs\n\nprint(f\"Interval between reception of two signals on the ship: {t:.2f} months\")\nprint(f\"Interval between reception of two signals on Earth: {t:.2f} months\")\nprint(f\"Wavelength ship receivers tuned to: {l_obs:.2f}\")\n\nInterval between reception of two signals on the ship: 7.59 months\nInterval between reception of two signals on Earth: 7.59 months\nWavelength ship receivers tuned to: 59.70 cm\n\n\n\n\nProblem 3\nBarnard’s star, named after American astronomer Edward E. Barnard (1857-1923), is an orange star in the constellation Ophiuchus. It has the largest proper motion (\\(\\mu=10.3577\\)” yr\\(^{-1}\\)) and the fourth-largest parallax (p = 0.54901”). In the spectrum of Barnard’s star, the H\\(\\alpha\\) absorption line is observed to have a wavelength of 656.034 nm when measured from the ground.\n\nDetermine the radial velocity of Barnard’s star.\nDetermine the transverse velocity of Barnard’s star.\nCalculate the speed of Barnard’s star through space.\nConsider that the Sun orbits the Milky Way at ~220 km/s, is Barnard’s star traveling particularly fast?\n\n\nAnswer: If we calculate the redshift \\[z = \\frac{\\lambda_{obs} - \\lambda_{rest}}{\\lambda_{rest}}\\] of the H\\(\\alpha\\) absorption line, we can use the following relationship to determine the radial velocity. \\[\\frac{v_r}{c} = \\frac{(z+1)^2 - 1}{(z+1)^2 + 1}\\]\nFor the transverse velocity, we need to multiply the proper motion and the distance to the target (which can be found via parallax), by a conversion factor of 4.74 to convert to units of km/s. \\[v_t = 4.74\\mu r\\] Adding the radial and transverse velocities in quadrature results in the total velocity of the star. \\[v = \\sqrt{v_r^2 + v_t^2}\\] Below is a Python script to perfom the above calculations.\n\n\n# a\nl_obs = 656.034 * u.nm\np = 0.54901 * u.arcsec\nmu = 10.3577 * u.arcsec / u.yr\n\nl_rest = 656.281 * u.nm\nz = (l_obs - l_rest) / l_rest\nv_r = (((z + 1) ** 2 - 1) / ((z + 1) ** 2 + 1)) * c.c\n\n# b\nr = p.to(u.pc, equivalencies=u.parallax())\nv_t = 4.74 * u.yr / u.arcsec / u.pc * u.km / u.s * mu * r \n\n#c\nv = np.sqrt(v_r ** 2 + v_t ** 2)\n\nprint(f\"radial velocity: {v_r.to(u.km / u.s):.2f}\")\nprint(f\"transverse velocity: {v_t:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"velocity: {v.to(u.km / u.s):.2f}\")\n\nradial velocity: -112.85 km / s\ntransverse velocity: 89.43 km / s\nvelocity: 143.99 km / s\n\n\n\nNote that the speed of Bernard’s star is less than that of the Sun with respect to the Milky Way, so the final speed is not particularly fast.\n\n\n\nProblem 4\nA white dwarf is a very dense star, with its ions and electrons packed extremely close together. Each electron may be considered to be located within a region of size \\(\\Delta x\\sim1.5\\times10^{-12}\\) m.\n\nUse Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle to estimate the minimum speed of the electron.\n\nDo you think that the effects of relativity will be important for these stars?\n\nAgain, using the ADS and/or ArXiV search engine tools, identify a recent (within the past few years) peer-reviewed scholarly manuscript that deals with white dwarf stars. Provide a brief summary of the main results of the paper, including a discussion of how the material connects to the concepts that we discussed in Chapter 5 of the textbook.\n\n\nAnswer: Rearranging the Heisenberg uncertainty principle to solve for the velocity \\[\\Delta v = \\frac{\\hbar}{2 m_e \\Delta x}\\] allows us to find the minimum velocity an electron must travel at given we know it’s location with a given uncertainty.\nA simple Python script below performs the above calculations.\n\n\ndx = 1.5E-12 * u.m\n\ndv = c.hbar / (2 * dx * c.m_e) \ndv.to(u.m / u.s)\n\n\nprint(f\"minimum speed of electron: {dv.to(u.m / u.s):.2e}\")\nprint(f\"v / c = {dv.to(u.m / u.s) / c.c:.2f}\")\n\nminimum speed of electron: 3.86e+07 m / s\nv / c = 0.13\n\n\n\nNote that the speed is just over 10% the speed of light, which is much greater than normal, everyday speeds we are used to. Given this, I would say relativistic effects would be just starting to have a noticable effect.\nThe Optically Thick Rotating Magnetic Wind from a Massive White Dwarf Merger Product. II. Axisymmetric Magnetohydrodynamic Simulations:\nSometimes white dwarfs collide, and when they do, they could: 1) trigger a supernova, 2) create a neutron star, or 3) merge into a single white dwarf. The latter was the topic of this paper, in particular, this team modeled the stellar wind that is created by the fast spinning and strong magnetic fields and carries mass away from the star. This team found that the wind is fastest and most luminous near the star’s equator and blows with an inconsistancy: some of the gas gets trapped in the magnetic field and subsequently ejected with the rearranging of the magnetic field lines. This is related to Chapter 5 in our textbook primarily with the fact that white dwarfs are found via spectroscopic (and photometric) methods, however, observationally, winds of a neutron star are measured via spectroscopy."

    "text": "Problem 1\nThe Event Horizon Telescope revolutionized our understanding of black holes by producing the first image of the immediate region surrounding one such structure in the galaxy M87. The theoretical diffraction limit of the EHT is given in the discovery paper.\nTo demonstrate how amazing this is, consider that normal human hair grows at the rate of a half an inch per month. Imagine you could use the EHT to observe a human standing on the surface of the moon at its perigee orbital position. Using Lunar parameters from this page, how long (in units of days) will you have to wait for this instrument to be able to measure the growth of that human’s hair?\n\nAnswer: The diffraction limit is esstentially the smallest angle we are able to see with a telescope. According the discovery paper, the diffraction limit of the EHT is \\(25\\mu\\)as. Now the question becomes: If we place a person on the Moon at perigee, how long will we have to wait before we can observe their hair growing?\nUsing trig, we can determine the length corresponding to our diffraction angle at a distance of the Moon’s perigee. Dividing that length by the hair growth rate will tell us how long we would have to wait before we can resolve the image of the hair.\nThe code below does just that.\n\n\nimport astropy.units as u\nimport astropy.constants as c\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndiff_limit_EHT = 25 * 1E-6 * u.arcsec\n\nhair_growth_rate = 0.5 / 39.37 * u.meter / (1/12 * u.yr)\n\nmoon_perigee = 0.3633 * 1E6 * u.km\n\nphysical_diff_lim = moon_perigee * np.tan(diff_limit_EHT)\n\ntime = physical_diff_lim / hair_growth_rate\n\n\nprint(f\"Wait time: {time.to(u.yr) * 365 / u.yr:.2f} days\")\n\nWait time: 105.46 days\n\n\nNote that this time is approximately 3 months, which would correspond to hair that is 1.5 inches in length. Putting this all into context, the EHT can resolve the 1.5 inch long hair of a person on the Moon at perigee.\n\n\nProblem 2\nConsider a radio telescope operating in the S-band, which covers the frequency range of 2-4 GHz. Imagine that the telescope’s frequency dependence is triangular, meaning that the sensitivity of the detector is zero at the edges and maximal at band center.\nThis filter function is expressed as\n\\[f_\\nu = \\frac{\\nu}{\\nu_m - \\nu_l} - \\frac{\\nu_l}{\\nu_m - \\nu_l}\\text{ for } \\nu_l\\leq\\nu\\leq\\nu_m\\] \\[f_\\nu = -\\frac{\\nu}{\\nu_u - \\nu_m} + \\frac{\\nu_u}{\\nu_u - \\nu_m}\\text{ for } \\nu_m\\leq\\nu\\leq\\nu_u\\] \\[f_\\nu = 0\\text{ for all other }\\nu\\]\nHere \\(f_\\nu\\) is the filter function, \\(\\nu_m\\) is the mid-point frequency, \\(\\nu_u\\) is the upper (higher) frequency, and \\(\\nu_l\\) is the lower frequency.\nYou observe with this system at a frequency of 3.2 GHz with a bandwidth of 80 MHz.\n\nWhat are \\(\\nu_m\\), \\(\\nu_u\\), and \\(\\nu_l\\)?\n\nAssume that the radio dish is 100% efficient over the observing bandwidth and that the diameter of the dish is 65 m.

What is the power emitted by this source?\n\n\nAnswer: Given our observing frequency and bandwitdth, the corresponding mid, lower, and upper frequencies are simply the center and bounds created by our bandwidth, centered at the observing frequency.

Thus our total number density of blackbody photons is\n\\[\\boxed{n = 16\\pi\\zeta(3)\\left(\\frac{kT}{ch}\\right)^3 \\approx 19.2329\\pi\\left(\\frac{kT}{ch}\\right)^3}\\]\nThe total blackbody energy density over all wavelengths is \\[u = aT^4, \\quad a = \\frac{4\\sigma}{c} = 7.566\\cdot10^{-16}\\frac{\\text{J}}{\\text{m}^2 \\text{K}^4}\\]\nIf we divide the total blackbody energy density by our number density for blackbody photons found above, we should get the average energy per photon for a blackbody with temperature \\(T\\).\n\\[\\boxed{\\bar{E}_\\gamma = \\frac{u}{n} = \\frac{aT^4}{16\\pi\\zeta(3)\\left(\\frac{kT}{ch}\\right)^3} \\approx 2.70 T}\\]\n\n\n\nProblem 2\nA ground-based observatory makes two measurements of the specific intensity from a star:\n\n\\(I_1 = 7.51\\times10^{-12}\\) W m\\(^{-2}\\) is made at a zenith angle \\(\\theta_1=17.15\\) degrees\n\\(I_2 = 5.18\\times10^{-12}\\) W m\\(^{-2}\\) is made at a zenith angle \\(\\theta_2=37.86\\) degrees\n\n\nWhat is the vertical optical depth?\nWhat is the specific intensity above the Earth’s atmosphere (in W m$^-$2)?\n\n\nAnswer: For a ground based observer, the intensity as a function of optical depth goes as\n\\[I_\\lambda = I_{\\lambda,0} e^{-\\tau_{\\lambda,0}\\sec\\theta}\\]\nTaking the ratio of our measured intensities allows us to rearrange to solve for the intrinsic optical depth,\n\\[\\tau_{\\lambda,0} = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{I_{\\lambda,1}}{I_{\\lambda,2}}\\right)}{-\\sec\\theta_1 + \\sec\\theta_2}\\]\nwhere the vertical optical depth is airmass dependent.\n\\[\\tau_\\lambda = \\tau_{\\lambda,0}\\sec\\theta\\]\nOnce \\(\\tau_{\\lambda,0}\\) has been found, we can use either measured intensity and corresponding angle to determine the specific intensity before atmospheric attenuation.\n\\[I_{\\lambda,0} = \\frac{I_\\lambda}{e^{-\\tau_{\\lambda,0}\\sec\\theta}}\\]\nThe code chunk below performs the calculations described above.\n\n\nimport astropy.units as u\nimport numpy as np\n\nI1 = 7.51E-12 * u.W / u.m**2\nI2 = 5.18E-12 * u.W / u.m**2\ntheta1 = 17.15 * u.deg\ntheta2 = 37.86 * u.deg\n\ntau0 = np.log(I1 / I2) / (-(1/np.cos(theta1)) + (1/np.cos(theta2)))\ntau1 = tau0 / np.cos(theta1)\ntau2 = tau0 / np.cos(theta2)\nI0 = I1 / (np.exp(-tau0 / np.cos(theta1)))\n\nprint(f\"Intrinsic optical depth: {tau0:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"Vertical optical depth (I1): {tau1:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"Vertical optical depth (I2): {tau2:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"Specific intensity abover Earth's atmosphere: {I0:.2e}\")\n\nIntrinsic optical depth: 1.69\nVertical optical depth (I1): 1.77\nVertical optical depth (I2): 2.14\nSpecific intensity abover Earth's atmosphere: 4.39e-11 W / m2\n\n\n\n\nProblem 3\nIn this problem you will use the values of density and opacity at various points near the surface of a model star to calculate the optical depth. The model is that of a 1 Solar mass star with \\(T_{eff} = 5504\\) K. The data in stellar-opacity.dat (on Moodle) shows physical values in the outer 3.3% of the star’s radius; the surface of the star is at \\(r=7.1\\times10^8\\) m. We will use simple numerical integration to determine the optical depth in each region of the model. Recall that optical depth is defined by the relation Examining the data in the table, we see that we are given 42 model layers in the outer regions of the star. As one moves inward from the “surface” of the star to the interior, the values of \\(\\rho\\) and \\(\\kappa\\) change. We can determine the value of tau in each region by beginning with the outermost layer and working our way inward. To do this, we will apply the “Trapezoidal Rule”, a simple but effective numerical integration technique. The values of \\(\\tau\\) in each subsequent layer can be found by applying the relation\n\\[\\tau_{i+1} = \\tau_i - \\left(\\frac{\\kappa_i \\rho_i + \\kappa_{i+1} \\rho_{i+1}}{2}\\right)\\left(r_{i+1}-r_i\\right)\\]\nwhere \\(i\\) and \\(i+1\\) designate adjacent zones in the model. Find the optical depth at each point by numerically integrating the relation for tau using the trapezoidal rule as provided.\nUsing the software package of your choice, create six plots:\n\nkappa vs radius\nrho vs radius\ntau vs radius\nTemperature vs radius\ntau vs temperature\ntemperature vs physical depth into star\n\nEstimate graphically the depth that one “sees” as the “surface” of this model star by zooming in on the appropriate region of plot #6. Include a zoom and your numerical estimate for the depth in (km).\n\nAnswer: The code below calculates the optical depth using the trapezoidal rule numerical integration for \\(\\tau_{i+1}\\).\n\n\nfrom astropy.io import ascii\nimport astropy.units as u\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndata = ascii.read(\"stellar-opacity.dat\")\n\nm = 1 * u.M_sun\nt_eff = 5504 * u.K\nr = 7.1E8 * u.m\n\ntau_values = [0]\n\ntau = 0\nfor i in range(len(data) - 1):\n    tau1 = tau - (data[\"kappa\"][i] * data[\"rho\"][i] + \n        data[\"kappa\"][i + 1] * data[\"rho\"][i + 1]) / 2 * (data[\"r\"][i + 1] - data[\"r\"][i])\n    tau = tau1\n\n    tau_values.append(tau)\n\ndata[\"tau\"] = tau_values\ndata[\"physical_depth\"] = np.ones(len(data)) * r.value - data[\"r\"]\n\n\n# eddington approximation\ndata[\"temp\"] = (0.75 * t_eff ** 4 * (data[\"tau\"] + (2/3))) ** (1/4)\n\n# plotting relationships\n# kappa vs radius\nplt.figure(figsize=(8,10))\nplt.subplot(3,2,1)\nplt.scatter(y = data[\"kappa\"], x = data[\"r\"])\nplt.xlabel(\"radius [m]\")\nplt.ylabel(\"kappa [m^2/kg]\")\n\n# rho vs radius\nplt.subplot(3,2,2)\nplt.scatter(y = data[\"rho\"], x = data[\"r\"])\nplt.xlabel(\"radius [m]\")\nplt.ylabel(\"rho [kg/m^3]\")\n\n# tau vs radius\nplt.subplot(3,2,3)\nplt.scatter(y = data[\"tau\"], x = data[\"r\"])\nplt.xlabel(\"radius [m]\")\nplt.ylabel(\"tau\")\n\n# temp vs radius\nplt.subplot(3,2,4)\nplt.scatter(y = data[\"temp\"], x = data[\"r\"])\nplt.xlabel(\"radius [m]\")\nplt.ylabel(\"temp [K]\")\n\n# tau vs temp\nplt.subplot(3,2,5)\nplt.scatter(y = data[\"tau\"], x = data[\"temp\"])\nplt.xlabel(\"temp [K]\")\nplt.ylabel(\"tau\")\n\n# temp vs physical depth\nplt.subplot(3,2,6)\nplt.scatter(y = data[\"temp\"], x = data[\"physical_depth\"])\nplt.xlabel(\"physical depth [m]\")\nplt.ylabel(\"temp [K]\")\n\nplt.subplots_adjust(wspace=0.5, hspace=0.5)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code below finds the value of \\(\\tau\\) closest to 2/3, which corresponds to the optical depth we “see” as the “surface” and plots vertical and horizontal lines corresponding to the approximate physical depth and temperature, respectively.\n\n\n# calculate physical depth of optical depth = 2/3\nmask = (data[\"tau\"] &lt; 1) & (data[\"tau\"] &gt; 1/3)\nsubdata = data[\"tau\",\"physical_depth\",\"temp\"][mask]\nprint(subdata)\n\nplt.figure()\nplt.scatter(y = data[\"temp\"], x = data[\"physical_depth\"])\nplt.xlabel(\"physical depth [m]\")\nplt.ylabel(\"temp [K]\")\nplt.xlim(0, 0.2e7)\nplt.ylim(0,10000)\nplt.vlines(subdata[\"physical_depth\"][1], linestyle = '--', color = \"orange\", \n            label = \"tau ~ 2/3\", ymax = subdata[\"temp\"][1], ymin = 0)\nplt.hlines(subdata[\"temp\"][1], linestyle = '--', color = \"orange\", \n            xmax = subdata[\"physical_depth\"][1], xmin = 0)\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n\n        tau         physical_depth        temp       \n                                           K         \n------------------- -------------- ------------------\n0.43573334109647177       904100.0 5248.4195311617905\n 0.6007624700982208       993800.0  5434.688576387231\n 0.8392023782404089      1091500.0  5674.015822750679\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, we can “see” (\\(\\tau \\sim 2/3\\)) to a physical depth of approximately \\(10^6\\) m into the star."
