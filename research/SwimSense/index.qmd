The goal of this project is to provide swimmers and coaches with all the resources they need to analyze their swimming technique through data. This project arose out of a desire of mine to improve my own technique, and was inspired by the work of Ken Ono and others with the University of Vrigina's Swim Team.

[Here is the link to the GitHub repo](https://github.com/wastjohn/SwimSense) where most of this project is documented, for the time being.
