Using data collected from the Robert L. Mutel Telescope, we performed g’, i’, and r’ photometry to determine the structural parameters of ~20 globular clusters, assuming King models. Our model parameters for core radius rc, tidal radius rt, and model constant k are presented and compared to the literature. Additionally, some of the targets have also been observed by Macalester’s 16-inch telescope, equipped with an SBIG CCD camera, located in St. Paul, MN. A comparison of the quality of data obtained at Macalester and those taken with the RLMT CMOS, located in Sonoita AZ, is presented.
