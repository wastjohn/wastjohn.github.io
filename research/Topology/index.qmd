During the Spring semester of my junior year at Macalester, I took a topology math class taught by Professor Lori Ziegelmeier. At the end of the course, we conducted and presented research on a topic of our choosing, showcasing our new skills in topological data analysis or TDA. [Here is a link to my final paper](../../courses/topology/paper.qmd) where I explored persisent images of graviationally lensed galaxies observed by the Euclid space telescope.

This project was extremely fun and exciting for me, particularly because TDA hasn't really been explored in the field of astronomy [except at the large-scale](https://donut.topology.rocks/?q=tag%3A%22Cosmology%22). I'm hoping to continue this project and explore TDA applications to astronomy and cosmology in the future.
